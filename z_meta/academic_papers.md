## How to read a paper
- Read intro and conclusion first
- Summarize the background and specific questions
- Determine purpose, structure, and direction
- Write down every word you don't understand
- Main points? Strengths? Weaknesses? Do the results answer the questions?
- Does the abstract jive with the rest of the paper?
- Look into citations
- What do other researchers say about the paper?
