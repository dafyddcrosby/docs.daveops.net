# Joke password policy

(I've forgotten where I found this)

> For immediate issue:
> Password changing guidelines V2.2b
> 
> Due to new security policies, the following guidelines have been issued to assist in choosing new passwords. Please follow them closely.
> 
> Passwords must conform to at least 21 of the following attributes.
> 
> 1.  Minimum length 8 characters
> 2.  Not in any dictionary.
> 3.  No word or phrase bearing any connection to the holder.
> 4.  Containing no characters in the ASCII character set.
> 5.  No characters typeable on a Sun type 5 keyboard
> 6.  No subset of one character or more must have appeared on Usenet news, /dev/mem, rand(3), or the King James bible (version 0.1alpha)
> 7.  Must be quantum theoretically secure, i.e. must automatically change if observed (to protect against net sniffing).
> 8.  Binary representation must not contain any of the sequences 00 01 10 11, commonly known about in hacker circles.
> 9.  Be provably different from all other passwords on the internet.
> 10. Not be representable in any human language or written script.
> 11. Colour passwords must use a minimum 32 bit pallette.
> 12. Changed prior to every use.
> 13. Resistant to revelation under threat of physical violence.
> 14. Contain tissue samples of at least 3 vital organs.
> 15. Incontravertible by OJ Simpsons lawyers.
> 16. Undecodable by virtue of application of 0 way hash function.
> 17. Odourless, silent, invisible, tasteless, weightless, shapeless, lacking form and inert.
> 18. Contain non-linear random S-boxes (without a backdoor).
> 19. Self-escrowable to enable authorities to capture kiddie-porn people and baddies but not the goodies ("but we'll only decode it with a court order, honest").
> 20. Not decryptable by exhaustive application of possible one time pads.
> 
> Due to the severity of the restrictions, if the password is entered incorrectly three (3) times at login time, you will be asked if you would like to pick a new one.
