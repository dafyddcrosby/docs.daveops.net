## Printing out letters with a labelmaker

Not what the typical advice is (which is generally to learn entirely from touch typing).

I think there's a middle road, and that's to print out the letters with a labelmaker. This helps on the pesky lesser-used letters, and gets your brain wrapped around the finger patterns faster. The letters will fall off naturally over time, replace as/if necessary.


## amphetype

Once you've wrapped your head around the keyboard basics it's more interesting to try typing in something other than random words.

## Tarmak

[Tarmak](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1858-learn-colemak-in-steps-with-the-tarmak-layouts/) is a way to transition incrementally to Colemak. Doesn't come standard with macOS.


## Colemak-DH

There's a slightly more ergonomic typing layout called [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/)

While there's [macOS keyboard layouts](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh/tree/master/macOS), apparently macOS will boot you back to a normal keyboard if you use these for sensitive inputs (which would be a big hassle/problem when typing in a hurry).
