# Anonymity


# The Circle by Dave Eggers


## The Rights of Humans in a Digital Age

- We must all have the right to anonymity
- Not every human activity can be measured
- The ceaseless pursuit of data to quantify the value of any endeavour is catastrophic to true understanding
- The barrier between public and private must remain unbreachable
- We must all have the right to disappear

# Joke password policy

(I've forgotten where I found this)

> For immediate issue: Password changing guidelines V2.2b
> 
> Due to new security policies, the following guidelines have been issued to assist in choosing new passwords. Please follow them closely.
> 
> Passwords must conform to at least 21 of the following attributes.
> 
> 1. Minimum length 8 characters
> 2. Not in any dictionary.
> 3. No word or phrase bearing any connection to the holder.
> 4. Containing no characters in the ASCII character set.
> 5. No characters typeable on a Sun type 5 keyboard
> 6. No subset of one character or more must have appeared on Usenet news, /dev/mem, rand(3), or the King James bible (version 0.1alpha)
> 7. Must be quantum theoretically secure, i.e.Â must automatically change if observed (to protect against net sniffing).
> 8. Binary representation must not contain any of the sequences 00 01 10 11, commonly known about in hacker circles.
> 9. Be provably different from all other passwords on the internet.
> 10. Not be representable in any human language or written script.
> 11. Colour passwords must use a minimum 32 bit pallette.
> 12. Changed prior to every use.
> 13. Resistant to revelation under threat of physical violence.

> 15. Incontravertible by OJ Simpsons lawyers.
> 16. Undecodable by virtue of application of 0 way hash function.
> 17. Odourless, silent, invisible, tasteless, weightless, shapeless, lacking form and inert.
> 18. Contain non-linear random S-boxes (without a backdoor).
> 19. Self-escrowable to enable authorities to capture kiddie-porn people and baddies but not the goodies ("but we'll only decode it with a court order, honest").
> 20. Not decryptable by exhaustive application of possible one time pads.
> 
> Due to the severity of the restrictions, if the password is entered incorrectly three (3) times at login time, you will be asked if you would like to pick a new one.
