## Adding to tmux buffers from shell

```shell
echo "hello" | tmux loadb -
tmux saveb - | sed 's,hello,hi,'
```


# SSH


## Generating a new key

```shell
# Generate a new RSA keypair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<username> generated <date>" -f id_rsa
# Generate a new ed25519 keypair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<username> generated <date>"
```


## Getting key fingerprint

```shell
ssh-keygen -lf .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```


## Security notes


### General

- Use protocol 2


### Client

- If using ssh-add (ie the ssh-agent), also use `-c` and `-t <seconds>` arguments, and use an askpass program to confirm connections
- Use HashKnownHosts to obscure which hosts you connect to. To retroactively do this on an existing file `ssh-keygen -H`


### Server

- Use something like fail2ban, and rate limit incoming connections

```
IgnoreRhosts yes
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
HostbasedAuthentication no

# Don't use tunneled cleartext passwords
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# Disable root user login
PermitRootLogin no

UsePam yes

# Disable X11 forwarding
X11Forwarding no
# Disable TCP forwarding (unless you *actually* need it)
AllowTcpForwarding no

# Lock down to specific group of users 
AllowGroup ssh_users

HostbasedAuthentication no
PermitUserEnvironment no
StrictModes yes
UsePrivilegeSeparation yes
```


## Troubleshooting

As silly as some of these seem, I've seen them all apply at one point or another.


### Client-side

- Are you using the correct key?
    - Confirm this using the -i flag

- Have you ordered your flags correctly?
    - Confirm this by looking at the man page - order is important!

- Is your username correct?
- Have you confirmed you're trying to connect to the right box?
    - Is the DNS record connect? is your SSH client correctly resolving to that address?
    - Do you need to have a VPN turned on?
    - Is your routing correct?
    - Does the fingerprint match?


### Server-side

- Is sshd running?
- Is the firewall open?
- Are the logs showing any connections?
