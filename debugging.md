# Debugging

## Bryan Cantrill

[Debugging Under Fire (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30jNsCVLpAE)

> Debugging is the process by which we understand pathological behavior in a software system

> The essence of debugging is asking and answering questions - and the craft of writing debuggable software is allowing the software to be able to answer questions about itself.

> Recovery in lieu of understanding normalizes broken software.

[The Three Best Debugging Tools](https://www.mikeperham.com/2013/09/12/the-three-best-debugging-tools/)

1. Your coworker
2. Your 'creative side'
3. Your Mental Model of the System

I agree a lot with #3 - often when I'm helping someone debugging, it's helping them establish this mental model.
