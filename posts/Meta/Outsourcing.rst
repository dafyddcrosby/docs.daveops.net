 If you aren't familiar with the term "vertical integration" it is the MBA
 term for "if you want something done right, do it yourself."

 Imagine trying to drive a car with someone else controlling the steering
 wheel. Now imagine that their incentives are perversely the opposite of yours.
 They get paid by how many turns they make. You get paid by how fast you get
 there. It just doesn't work. They control the wheel.
