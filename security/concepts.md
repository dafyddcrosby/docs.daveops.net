# Concepts

## Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

Understand the issues, risks

Assess, plan, design/architect

## Principle of Least Privilege

When designing a security policy, be it a firewall rule, or filesystem
permissions, never give more than the necessary permissions to get the job
done. Doing so reduces the attack surface, and weakens (though does not eliminate)
the potency of compromise. It's easier to loosen rules than to tighten them later.

## Appropriateness

The appropriateness of a security architecture is that it meeds the
confidentiality/integrity/availability needs of an organization. It balances
security, risk mitigation, usability, and costs.

## Non-repudiation

Where an action cannot be denied, proof of data integrity.

## Business continuity

One of the chief goals of security is that business continuity is ensured.
Beyond simple security practices, this is having systems in place that can
tolerate failure so that business continues with little/no affect.

## Hardening

A hardened system has these characteristics:

* Minimal amount of software (and hardware) installed and running - *only* what is needed
* Regular updates
* Privileges only for what is needed

## Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)

Team responsible for receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer security
incident reports and activity

## Security incident and event management

Monitors security-related events from network devices, servers, etc

Logs and alerts on anomalies, malicious activity, puts it into "single pane of glass"
