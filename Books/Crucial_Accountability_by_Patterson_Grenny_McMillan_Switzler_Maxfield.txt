How do I speak up about infractions so that dangerous behaviour is avoided
Find a polite way to interject - positive deviance

===== Know *what* convo to hold and *if* you should hold it =====

If you find yourself having the same convo again and again, there's another, larger violation that needs to be addressed.

".. [S]peed rarely leads to careful thought."

::

  You have to distill the issue to a single sentence. Lengthy descriptions of
  violated expectations only obscure the real issue. If you can’t reduce a
  violation to a clear sentence before you talk, the issue almost never becomes
  more understandable and focused as a conversation unfolds.

- Content - 'You did x,y,z'
- Pattern - 'This is Nth occurance'
- Relationship - 'This is putting a strain on our (work|friendship|marriage)'

Do you actually know the intention? Don't leap to conclusions
