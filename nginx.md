## Rotate logs

```bash
mv access.log access.log.0
kill -USR1 `cat master.nginx.pid`
sleep 1
gzip access.log.0    # do something with access.log.0
```

## Basic TLS config

Check for recent config at <https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/>

```nginx
server {
      listen 443 ssl;
  
      # certs sent to the client in SERVER HELLO are concatenated in ssl_certificate
      ssl_certificate /path/to/signed_cert_plus_intermediates;
      ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private_key;
      ssl_session_timeout 5m;
      ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:5m;
      ssl_session_tickets off;
      
      # Diffie-Hellman parameter for DHE ciphersuites, recommended 2048 bits
      ssl_dhparam /path/to/dhparam.pem;
  
      # Intermediate configuration. tweak to your needs.
      ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
      ssl_ciphers '<paste intermediate ciphersuite here>';
      ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  
      # Enable this if your want HSTS (recommended)
      # add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000;
  
      # OCSP Stapling ---
      # fetch OCSP records from URL in ssl_certificate and cache them
      ssl_stapling on;
      ssl_stapling_verify on;
      ## verify chain of trust of OCSP response using Root CA and Intermediate certs
      ssl_trusted_certificate /path/to/root_CA_cert_plus_intermediates;
      resolver <IP DNS resolver>;
  
      # ...
}
```

## Redirect only / query
```nginx
location = / {
      # this matches only the / query.
}
```

## Disable nginx version in header
In http, server, or location

## A funny aside

One of my coworkers said that "nginx is just a hipster Apache". I *wish* that's the most ignorant thing he's ever said (sit down with me for a beer, and I'll give a few other gems).
