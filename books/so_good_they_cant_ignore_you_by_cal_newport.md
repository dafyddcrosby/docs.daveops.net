# So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport

## three disqualifiers for applying the craftsman mindset

* job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable
* job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world
* job forces you to work with people you really dislike


## Control traps

1. Control that is acquired without career capital is unsustainable
2. The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you've become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change.


## The Law of Financial Viability
When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more
control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay
for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.

Work Right trumps finding the Right Work
