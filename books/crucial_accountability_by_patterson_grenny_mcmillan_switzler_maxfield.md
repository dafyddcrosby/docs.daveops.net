How do I speak up about infractions so that dangerous behaviour is avoided

Find a polite way to interject - positive deviance

## Know *what* convo to hold and *if* you should hold it

If you find yourself having the same convo again and again, there's another, larger violation that needs to be addressed.

".. [S]peed rarely leads to careful thought."

> You have to distill the issue to a single sentence. Lengthy descriptions of
> violated expectations only obscure the real issue. If you canâ€™t reduce a
> violation to a clear sentence before you talk, the issue almost never becomes
> more understandable and focused as a conversation unfolds.

* Content - 'You did x,y,z'
* Pattern - 'This is Nth occurrence'
* Relationship - 'This is putting a strain on our (work|friendship|marriage)'

Do you actually know the intention? Don't leap to conclusions
