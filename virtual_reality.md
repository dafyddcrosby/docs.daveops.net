# Virtual Reality


## Best Practices

[Oculus VR best practices](https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/book-bp/?_fb_noscript=1) [ISO 9241-391:2016](https://www.iso.org/standard/56350.html)

- Users should always be able to pause and return
- Incorporate resting positions
- Always test with newcomers
    - Those experienced with VR become accustomed to it, don't notice what would be discomfortable to newcomer

- Always start easy - not with hectic action
- Don't waste time - folks in VR can't log off for 5 seconds while waiting
- Present VR immediately on load (don't use loading screen)
- Show hands (or something else that provides presence points)
- Add audio (for better immersion)
- Don't limit to one browser (this goes beyond VR ;-)
