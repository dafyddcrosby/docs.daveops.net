===== Xerox PARC Principles =====


1. Visions not goals
2. Fund people not projects — the scientists find the problems not the funders.
   So, for many reasons, you have to have the best researchers.
3. Problem Finding — not just Problem Solving
4. Milestones not deadlines
5. It’s "baseball" not "golf" — batting .350 is very good in a high aspiration
   high risk area. Not getting a hit is not failure but the overhead for getting
   hits. (As in baseball, an "error" is failing to pull off something that is
   technically feasible.)
6. It’s about shaping "computer stuff" to human ends per the vision. Much of
   the time this required the researchers to design and build pretty much
   everything, including much of the hardware — including a variety of mainframes
   — and virtually all of the software needed (including OSs and programming
   languages, etc.). Many of the ARPA researchers were quite fluent in both HW and
   SW (though usually better at one than the other). This made for a pretty
   homogeneous computing culture and great synergy in most projects.
7. The above goes against the commonsense idea that "computer people should not
   try to make their own tools (because of the infinite Turing Tarpit that
   results)". The ARPA idea was a second order notion: "if you can make your own
   tools, HW and SW, then you must!". The idea was that if you are going to take
   on big important and new problems then you just have to develop the chops to
   pull off all needed tools, partly because of what "new" really means, and
   partly because trying to do workarounds of vendor stuff that is in the wrong
   paradigm will kill the research thinking.
8. An important part of the research results are researchers. This extends the
   "baseball" idea to human development. The grad schools, especially, generally
   admitted people who "seemed interesting" and judgements weren't made until a
   few years down the road. Many of the researchers who ultimately solved most of
   the many problems of personal computing and networking were created by the ARPA
   community.

Every invention has to be usable by at least 100 people.
