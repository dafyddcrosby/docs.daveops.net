# MySQL - Production Ready

## Remove all anonymous accounts

```sql
DROP USER ''@'localhost';
DROP USER ''@'hostname';
```

## Remove all non-localhost root users

## Remove test databases



  DELETE FROM mysql.db WHERE Db LIKE 'test%';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  DROP DATABASE test;

## Set timezone to UTC

For safe measure, don't just set the time zone in MySQL, but also set the system time zone to UTC

``default-time-zone=UTC``

## Change the default prompt


  [mysql]
  prompt="(\\U) [\d] > "
