:date: 2017-04-21

How to always have the right information to meet our need.

How do you avoid information fragmentation where you have the information, but no means of finding it? How do you keep found things found?

How do you manage your:

- videos
- photographs
- music
- contacts
- calendar
- mail
- documents
- todo list items

Do you know where your personal space of information ends?

Maintenance
-----------

How do you protect against

- material failure (eg hard drive failure)
- disaster (eg fire)
- theft
- corruption
- fragmentation
- age (keeping information up-to-date)

Money/Energy/Time

Things that make personal information personal:

- Controlled/owned by me
- About me
- Directed toward me
- Sent by me
- Experienced by me
- Relevant/useful to me

An information item is something that can be copied, (sometimes) moved, retrieved, and (sometimes) deleted

A task is an action, a project is the interdependency of those tasks

- hot information is in active use now
- warm information is information held for a later task
- cold information is no longer in active use

Finding is where a need demands information

Keeping is figuring out what to do with information 'in hand'

In the creation of a project, does how we categorize and file drive the success of a project?
