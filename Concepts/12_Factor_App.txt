====== 12 Factor App ======

http://www.12factor.net/

- Codebase

  - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys (i.e. it's all in Git)

- Dependencies

  - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies. Don't rely on system tools - app should be self-contained.

- Config

  - Store config using environment variables (which won't be accidentally committed). Ask yourself "could this be open-sourced *right now*?"

- Backing Services

  - Treat backing services as attached resources

- Build, release, run

  - Strictly separate build and run stages

- Processes

  - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

- Port binding
  
  - Export services via port binding

- Concurrency
  
  - Scale out via the process model

- Disposability
  
  - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

- Dev/prod parity
  
  - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

- Logs
  
  - Treat logs as event streams

- Admin processes
  
  - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
