	Amazingly, the ISP didn't try to cover up the outage as 
	  some kind of network issue, power spike or a bad firmware upgrade. They 
	  didn't lie to their customers at all. Instead, they promptly published 
	  a press release about their modems having been vulnerable which allowed 
	  their customers to assess their potential risk exposure. What did the 
	  most honest ISP in the world get for its laudable transparency? Sadly 
	  it got little more than criticism and bad press. It's still the most 
	  depressing case of 'why we can't have nice things' to me, and probably 
	  the main reason for why 99% of security mistakes get covered up and the 
	  actual victims get left in the dark. Too often 'responsible disclosure'
	  simply becomes a euphemism for 'coverup.'
