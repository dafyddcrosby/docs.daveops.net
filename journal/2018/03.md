## Juggling with packets
	  As such, the Internet has a non-zero momentary data storage capacity.
	  It is possible to push out a piece of information and effectively have
	  it stored until echoed back. By establishing a mechanism for cyclic
	  transmission and reception of chunks of data to and from a number of
	  remote hosts, it is possible to maintain an arbitrary amount of data
	  constantly `on the wire', thus establishing a high-capacity volatile
	  medium.
