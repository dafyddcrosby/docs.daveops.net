# DaveOps.net

This is daveops.net, my little repo of code snippets and chunks of wisdom that's in no particular organized state.

The formatting of some pages are likely wrong, as many of the pages were ripped out of [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) (which was no longer up to the task), then [ReStructuredText](markup-languages.md), then [Zim](https://www.zim-wiki.org/), and now [Markdown](markup-languages.md) (for a few different engines).

Pull requests are appreciated, but added at my discretion.
