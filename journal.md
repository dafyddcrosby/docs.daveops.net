> This of course is sad because we software developers are among the few people who are able to understand the strengths and weaknesses of formats. We have a moral duty to choose wisely the formats we use because everybody else will blindly use whatever formats we choose.

## Exim pre-auth RCE

## Juggling with packets
	  As such, the Internet has a non-zero momentary data storage capacity.
	  It is possible to push out a piece of information and effectively have
	  it stored until echoed back. By establishing a mechanism for cyclic
	  transmission and reception of chunks of data to and from a number of
	  remote hosts, it is possible to maintain an arbitrary amount of data
	  constantly `on the wire', thus establishing a high-capacity volatile
	  medium.

	exploit something based on the alignment of certain bytes that occur naturally
	in a process’ address space

## BrickerBot update
Dude destroys tons of equipment, points out internet is broken.
<http://archive.is/PQAnU>
	Amazingly, the ISP didn't try to cover up the outage as 
	  some kind of network issue, power spike or a bad firmware upgrade. They 
	  didn't lie to their customers at all. Instead, they promptly published 
	  a press release about their modems having been vulnerable which allowed 
	  their customers to assess their potential risk exposure. What did the 
	  most honest ISP in the world get for its laudable transparency? Sadly 
	  it got little more than criticism and bad press. It's still the most 
	  depressing case of 'why we can't have nice things' to me, and probably 
	  the main reason for why 99% of security mistakes get covered up and the 
	  actual victims get left in the dark. Too often 'responsible disclosure'
	  simply becomes a euphemism for 'coverup.'

## The Pathologies of Big Data
<http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874>
``"In designing applications to handle ever-increasing amounts of data, developers would do well to remember that hardware specs are improving too, and keep in mind the so-called ZOI (zero-one-infinity) rule, which states that a program should “allow none of foo, one of foo, or any number of foo.” That is, limits should not be arbitrary; ideally, one should be able to do as much with software as the hardware platform allows."``

``"... big data should be defined at any point in time as “data whose size forces us to look beyond the tried-and-true methods that are prevalent at that time.”``
