## Column store

50-100 times faster (according to Stonebraker) (data?)
Only reads the columns needed, not the entire store

## OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)


## High-Availability

CAP theorem - consistency, availability, partition tolerance

## Log-Structured Merge Trees

Record data and changes in immutable segments.
When data is inserted/changed, the top level fills up and its data is copied into a new segment (compaction)
LevelDB, Apache HBase, Hyperdex, Cassandra, RocksDB, WiredTiger, Riak

Advantages:

* immutable storage segments easily cached+backed up
* writes are append-only, no need for read
* fragmentation not an issue (or replaced by simpler problems)
* less wear on SSDs (can't update data in-place)
