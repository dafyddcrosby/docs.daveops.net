# Network Names
Have a formal grammar for parsing

Don't rely on institutional memory - a person with fresh eyes should know where
and what everything is just by reading the records

Don't use vendor type/make/model in DNS name

Use CNAMEs to wean off old names

Pre-derive all current names before committing to a name scheme
