"What Seymour threw out the window, Les [Davis] would catch."

- Start fresh with every new project
- Design simply using proven technologies
- Use old, solid, well-tested methods for design
- Work in small groups with a single decision maker
- Space matters, but do it right
- It's not about having a fast CPU, but a fast *system*
- Make things simple, but know where to stop.

> I guess I have faith. That's a little different than confidence. I've been well taken care of in my lifetime. God looks after me so to speak and so if you have faith that you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, you're doing the best you can, then as I view it, you can leave the responsibilities for all of the peripheral aspects of life to someone else. So far that's worked for me.
