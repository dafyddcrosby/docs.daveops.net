## Hiring

- They'd love for you to start today (ship is on fire/sinking)

## Day-to-day

- QA/Dev/Ops refuse to work together on problems
- Small things like coffee, first-aid kits, etc start getting cut. Saving pennies at the expense of worker general satisfaction
- People get upset that you're not working outside of your 8 hours a day. This includes checking email, answering phone calls (outside of on-call)
