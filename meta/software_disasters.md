# Software Disasters

This is a list of software disasters where bugs had real-world repercussions
beyond typical annoyance.

## Mariner 1 rocket
Transcription mistake sent rocket off-course

## Hartford Coliseum Collapse
CAD software didn't take into account wet snow

## Therac-25
Race condition gave lethal doses of radiation

## 1983 Soviet early-warning ballistic detection system
Software did not account for false detections from clouds, nearly started WW3

## Knight Capital Trading glitch
Insufficient cleanup of program artifacts, lack of testing, and lack of monitoring led to $440 million loss in 30 minutes.

## 1990 AT&T Outage
Single line of code knocked out a single switch, shuts down national phone network

## 1991 Patriot system
Miscalculation of trajectory because of rounding error

## Pentium FPU (f00f bug)

## Cyrix Coma bug

## Arianne 5
64-bit to 16-bit conversion, causing an overflow that knocked out the guidance system. Backup system had identical problem.

## Y2K bug
Shortening year to two digits causes overflow at turn of century

## 2038 bug
32-bit time_t overflows in year 2038

## Mars Orbiter
Mismatch of metric and imperial measurements puts orbiter wildly off-course.

## Virtual Case File

Less a case of any one bug, and more program mismanagement. $170 million spent
before program scrapped. A case study in why following software engineering
best practices matters.
