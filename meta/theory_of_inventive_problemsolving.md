## Theory

From ["What is TRIZ?"](https://triz-journal.com/what-is-triz/)

1. That the same problems and solutions appear again and again across different
   industries, but that most organisations tend to re-invent the wheel rather
   than look outside their own experiences or the experiences of their direct
   competitors.
2. That the most powerful solutions are the ones that successfully eliminate
   the compromises and trade-offs conventionally viewed as inherent in systems.
3. That there are only a small number of possible strategies for overcoming
   such contradictions.
4. That the most powerful solutions also make maximum use of resources. Most
   organisations are highly inclined to solve problems by adding things rather
   than making the current things work more effectively, or transforming the
   things viewed as harmful into something useful.
5. That technology evolution trends follow highly predictable paths.

The Ideal Final Result (IFR) is when the product has no costs/harms to the customer.

Five Pillars:
* Ideality
* Contradictions
