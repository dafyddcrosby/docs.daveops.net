title: Sysadmin Life
---

* Write great documentation, not necessarily for others, but for your own sanity
* Assume that you typing something in is the weakest link in any chain. If it can be automated, it should be.

## Outside of work

* Sleep is precious. Invest in a nice bed, keep light out of the room, keep caffeinated substance consumption to a minimum.
* If you're on-call, assume things will break any minute. Shower, middle of a meal, while you're hanging a chandelier - the most inconvenient time. Schedule accordingly.
