## Building A Learning Organization

>> Knowing how is partial knowledge; it is rooted in norms of behavior, standards
>> of practice, and settings of equipment. Knowing why is more fundamental: it
>> captures underlying cause-and-effect relationships and accommodates exceptions,
>> adaptations, and unforeseen events.

Deming's "Plan, Do, Check, Act"

### Peter Senge's 5 component technologies

* systems thinking
* personal mastery
* mental models
* shared vision
* team learning

>> Most discussions of learning organizations finesse these issues. Their focus is
>> high philosophy and grand themes, sweeping metaphors rather than the gritty
>> details of practice. Three critical issues are left unresolved; yet each is
>> essential for effective implementation. First is the question of meaning. We
>> need a plausible, well-grounded definition of learning organizations; it must be
>> actionable and easy to apply. Second is the question of management. We need
>> clearer guidelines for practice, filled with operational advice rather than high
>> aspirations. And third is the question of measurement. We need better tools for
>> assessing an organizationâ€™s rate and level of learning to ensure that gains have
>> in fact been made.

* Don't let your own emotions cloud the message.
