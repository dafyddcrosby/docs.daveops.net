====== Selling a business ======
==================
:date: 2016-06-27

Sell for 2-4x trailing-twelve-months revenue minus expenses

Use a broker to sell the business:

- weeds out flakes
- build a prospectus
- escrow, delivery

Avoid cross-contamination with other businesses

===== What buyers look for =====
--------------------

- Established business (6+ years)
- Recurring revenue
- Low technical risk (rails app vs lisp monster)
- Low market risk (will remain valuable over the coming years)
- Good documentation (solid bookkeeping, guide to running the business)

===== Avoid =====
--------------------

- "no money down"
- anonymous sales
- people who aren't capable of running the business
- people who negotiate for weeks then demand a discount right before contract signing

===== Brokers =====
--------------------

Take a 10-15% cut (generally worth it - much lower risk, higher negotiated price)
