====== Meetings ======


==== Start of the meeting ====
* Give at least 30m notice, in addition to any extra time people might need to gather information
* Everything on the table, no surprises
* Don't start just before your lunch or before the end of the business day when people will be leaving
* Have an agenda with stated goals and a scheduled end time
* If you're going to use the projector or teleconferencing, come in 5m earlier than start time so you don't bungle the first critical minutes

==== During the meeting ====
* Don't marry your ideas - be open to suitable alternatives
* Keep a list of actionable items
* Be objective
* When it seems that a conversation is going into technical details best handled outside of the meeting, say so, try to get back to the agenda

==== End of the meeting ====
* At scheduled endtime, decide if you need to continue. Let people who need to leave go, and maybe take a 5 minute breather to clear your head. Set a new end time.
* Do a quick overview of the action items, confirm you've hit all agenda points.

===== Meetings, Bloody Meetings =====
1. plan - be precise about the objectives and why you need the meeting
2. inform - what people need to bring to the meeting
3. prepare - the logical sequence of items (prioritizing the important)
4. structure and control - present evidence first, then discuss without jumping around
5. summarize and record - write down the who/what of action items, decisions
